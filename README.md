# About
Worpy is a custom word-search generator written in python3. You can use whatever words you want provided that the grid size is bigger than the biggest word you are going to hide so it'll fit.

# Example
Here is an example of what gets generated. This is the default list of words to find in a grid that is the size of "11", or an 11x11.
